## Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains my solution for the **Kaggle Titanic Competition**.  
The challenge is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and family relations.  

This project demonstrates the **end-to-end machine learning workflow**:  
✅ Data exploration & visualization  
✅ Data cleaning & preprocessing  
✅ Feature engineering  
✅ Model training & evaluation  
✅ Kaggle submission  

## ⚙️ Project Workflow  

### 1. Data Exploration  
- Checked missing values  
- Explored categorical vs numerical features  
- Visualized distributions and correlations  

### 2. Data Preprocessing  
- Filled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`, `Fare`)  
- Encoded categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`)  

### 3. Model Training  
Tested  ML algorithms:  
- Logistic Regression  

### 4. Model Evaluation  
- Accuracy score  
- Confusion matrix  
- Cross-validation  
- Kaggle leaderboard submission
